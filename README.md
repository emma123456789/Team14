HI heres some notes i took down during today's demo 17/8/2018


4230 queue on matlab 
*try to get communication between matlab and robot studio, comment on code, use git
1. figure design (fiddly job) 
2. smaller tasks ie log, sends and receives in guis, printing error, color coded, functions that add messages to queue in individual files (protocol messages)
3. CAD model of robot cell  (part1, robostudio)
4. setting up things in robot studio (get simulation working)
5. create a simple server 
- robotstudio is working on a simple server. 
- ideal to test code as individual as possible. make sure matlab and robstudio works 
- axe windows server & macos/linux version of same file. 
6. getting webcam working to get live view into the figure

guied is different on mac and windows in matlab

reyma douglas peucker algorithm (line simplifier) checks if all points within are set within a certain tolerance. can detect blocks in clusters and where the two blocks are. 
if theres 90degree internal angle, theres a block.
